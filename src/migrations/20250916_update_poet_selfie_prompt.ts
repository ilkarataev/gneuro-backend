IMPORTANT: Both people should be fully dressed in appropriate clothing for the {{poetEra}} era. If one person appears shirtless or inappropriately dressed, dress them in period-appropriate clothing.

The first image shows {{poetFullName}} ({{poetName}}), and the second image shows the user.

Requirements:
- Both people should stand next to each other, not overlapping
- Preserve the natural identity, face geometry, and expressions of both individuals
- Ensure both subjects are fully dressed in {{poetEra}} era clothing
- Maintain consistent lighting and photo quality for both people
- The photo should look like a genuine historical photograph from the {{poetEra}} era
- High resolution, professional quality, realistic appearance

Make sure the final image looks like a real photograph taken together, not a digital composite.`;
